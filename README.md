# Data Analysis Results

{The data set I am going over is about life expectancy in different countries. I would like to learn what country has the highest life expectancy. Which one has the lowest. I will also find some averages and learn how to graph data. }

# Development Environment

{Our program will be created in the Python language. To accomplish our task we will use Pandas which is a library created for python to manipulate data.}

{We will also use Mataplotlib which is a tool for plotting graphs. }

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add a way to include user input to select just one country at a time. 
* Let the user pic what type of graph to show.
* Let the user pass in their own list of countries and numbers.
